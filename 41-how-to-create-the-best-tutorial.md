# Build Your First Actionable Tutorial: From Broken to Brilliant in 20 Minutes

> **TL;DR:** This guide shows you how to create tutorials people actually finish—fast. You'll build a real, actionable example (install Node.js), get a reusable template, and a quality checklist. Skip to the template at the end if you're in a hurry.

> **Your readers abandon tutorials because they're boring information dumps. Let's fix that by building a working example together.**

## The Problem: 89% Tutorial Abandonment

Most tutorials fail because they teach ABOUT doing instead of actually DOING.

**Today we fix this by building a real tutorial step-by-step.**

## 🎯 What You'll Build

**In 20 minutes, you'll create:**

- ✅ A working "Install Node.js" tutorial using the ACTION framework

- ✅ All the templates you need for future tutorials
- ✅ A checklist to ensure every tutorial succeeds
