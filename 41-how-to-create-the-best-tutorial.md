# Build Your First Actionable Tutorial: From Broken to Brilliant in 20 Minutes

> **Your readers abandon tutorials because they're boring information dumps. Let's fix that by building a working example together.**

## The Problem: 89% Tutorial Abandonment

Most tutorials fail because they teach ABOUT doing instead of actually DOING.

**Today we fix this by building a real tutorial step-by-step.**

## 🎯 What You'll Build

**In 20 minutes, you'll create:**

- ✅ A working "Install Node.js" tutorial using the ACTION framework

- ✅ All the templates you need for future tutorials
- ✅ A checklist to ensure every tutorial succeeds
