# Your Task

Review each content piece and suggest where Mermaid diagrams could enhance understanding. Provide clear, concise suggestions for diagrams that would visually clarify complex information.

Ensure that your suggestions are specific, actionable, and aligned with the content's educational goals. Don't add diagrams for the sake of it; only suggest them where they will genuinely aid comprehension.

## Guidelines for Suggesting Mermaid Diagrams

When reviewing content, identify specific paragraphs or examples where complex concepts, processes, or relationships would benefit from visual explanation using Mermaid diagrams. Only suggest diagrams where visualization genuinely clarifies difficult-to-understand material.

### For Each Suggested Diagram

- **Keep designs simple:** Limit each diagram to 5â€“7 nodes maximum.
- **Break down complexity:** If a concept is too complex, split it into multiple focused diagrams rather than one overcrowded chart (use multiple Mermaid blocks).
- **Select appropriate diagram types:** Choose the most suitable diagram type (e.g., flowchart, sequence, class) based on the concept being illustrated.

### Design Requirements

- **Color scheme:** Use nice pastel colors with high contrast between text and background.
- **Readability:** Ensure text remains clearly readable against background colors.
- **Aesthetics:** Maintain a professional, clean look that enhances comprehension.
- **Meaningful color use:** Apply colors purposefully (e.g., similar elements share colors; use contrasting colors for different elements).

> **Tip:** Focus on clarity and simplicity to maximize the effectiveness of each diagram.

Strictly follow ./prompts/01_mermaid_rules.md for the Mermaid syntax and structure. Ensure all diagrams are well-formed and adhere to the specified guidelines.
