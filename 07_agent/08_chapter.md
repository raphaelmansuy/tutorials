# Chapter 8: Sessions & Memory - Building Persistent Intelligence

> *"An agent without memory is like a consultant who forgets everything after each meeting. An agent with memory is like a trusted advisor who knows your business history."* - The Memory Advantage

## Why Memory Transforms Agents from Tools to Partners

Imagine your AI agent remembering that three months ago, you expressed concern about supply chain resilience. Today, when analyzing a new vendor proposal, it proactively highlights supply chain risk factors and references your previous concerns. It recalls that your Q3 budget discussions focused on cost optimization, so it emphasizes the cost savings in its analysis. It knows your decision-making style prefers data-driven recommendations with clear risk assessments.

This isn't just convenience - it's **persistent intelligence**. Agents with memory don't just process individual requests; they build understanding, maintain context, and develop deeper insights over time. They evolve from reactive tools into proactive business partners.

**Why should you master agent memory systems?** Because in business, context is everything. The most valuable advisors aren't those who give perfect one-time answers - they're those who understand your business, remember your preferences, learn from your decisions, and get better over time.

## From Stateless Processors to Stateful Partners

### The Limitations of Stateless Agents

Traditional stateless agents face fundamental constraints:

**No Learning:** Each interaction starts from zero knowledge
**Lost Context:** Previous conversations and decisions are forgotten
**Repetitive Inefficiency:** Same questions asked repeatedly  
**No Personalization:** Cannot adapt to user preferences and patterns
**Broken Continuity:** Long-term projects lack coherent progression

### The Memory-Enabled Advantage

Agents with persistent memory can:

**Build Relationships:** Understand user preferences, communication styles, and business context
**Maintain Context:** Remember long-term projects and ongoing initiatives
**Learn from History:** Improve recommendations based on past decisions and outcomes
**Provide Continuity:** Pick up conversations and projects where they left off
**Personalize Interactions:** Adapt communication style and focus areas to individual users

## The Five Types of Agent Memory

### 1. Working Memory: Session State

**Purpose:** Maintains information for the current conversation session using ADK's Session State

**Real-World Example:** Customer Service Agent

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
from google.adk.runners import Runner

# Customer service agent with session state
customer_service_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="customer_service_representative",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="""
    You are a customer service representative helping customers with their inquiries.
    
    Use the session state to:
    - Track the customer's current issue and all attempts to resolve it
    - Remember what solutions have already been tried
    - Maintain awareness of customer sentiment throughout the conversation
    - Keep track of any promises or commitments made
    
    Always reference previous parts of the conversation to provide coherent, 
    helpful service without asking customers to repeat themselves.
    """,
    output_key="last_response",  # Save responses to session state
    tools=[check_account_status, update_ticket, escalate_to_specialist]
)

# Set up session service for persistent state management
session_service = InMemorySessionService()
runner = Runner(
    agent=customer_service_agent,
    app_name="customer_service_app",
    session_service=session_service
)

# Example interaction flow with session state
async def handle_customer_conversation():
    app_name = "customer_service_app"
    user_id = "customer_123"
    session_id = "session_001"
    
    # Create session
    session = await session_service.create_session(
        app_name=app_name,
        user_id=user_id,
        session_id=session_id
    )
    
    # Customer's first message
    from google.genai.types import Content, Part
    user_input1 = Content(parts=[Part(text="Hi, I'm having trouble with my order #12345. It was supposed to arrive yesterday.")], role="user")
    
    final_response1 = None
    async for event in runner.run_async(user_id=user_id, session_id=session_id, new_message=user_input1):
        if event.is_final_response() and event.content and event.content.parts:
            final_response1 = event.content.parts[0].text
    
    print(f"Agent Response 1: {final_response1}")
    
    # Customer provides more information
    user_input2 = Content(parts=[Part(text="I've checked with shipping and they say it's on the truck.")], role="user")
    
    final_response2 = None
    async for event in runner.run_async(user_id=user_id, session_id=session_id, new_message=user_input2):
        if event.is_final_response() and event.content and event.content.parts:
            final_response2 = event.content.parts[0].text
    
    print(f"Agent Response 2: {final_response2}")
    
    # Agent maintains context and can handle address change in context of delivery delay
    user_input3 = Content(parts=[Part(text="Actually, I need to update my delivery address.")], role="user")
    
    final_response3 = None
    async for event in runner.run_async(user_id=user_id, session_id=session_id, new_message=user_input3):
        if event.is_final_response() and event.content and event.content.parts:
            final_response3 = event.content.parts[0].text
    
    print(f"Agent Response 3: {final_response3}")
    
    # Get session summary
    final_session = await session_service.get_session(app_name=app_name, user_id=user_id, session_id=session_id)
    return final_session.state
```

**Business Impact:** Organizations implementing ADK memory systems typically see significant improvements, though specific metrics vary by use case and implementation quality.

### 2. Long-Term Memory: Using MemoryService

**Purpose:** Stores information across sessions for future retrieval using ADK's MemoryService

**Real-World Example:** Investment Advisory Agent

```python

memory_search_tool = FunctionTool(func=search_investment_memory)

investment_advisor = LlmAgent(
    name="investment_advisor",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="""
    You are an investment advisor who learns from every interaction and outcome.

## ADK Memory and Session Architecture

### Core ADK Memory Components

Google ADK provides a streamlined approach to memory management through two primary systems:

1. **Session State**: Short-term memory within individual conversations
2. **MemoryService**: Long-term knowledge storage across sessions

```python

## Production Deployment: Vertex AI Agent Engine

### Deploying Memory-Enabled Agents to Production

Google ADK integrates with Vertex AI Agent Engine for production deployment. Here's the correct approach:

```python
# Install required dependencies
# pip install google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]

import vertexai
from vertexai.preview import reasoning_engines
from vertexai import agent_engines

# Initialize Vertex AI
PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
LOCATION = "us-central1"
STAGING_BUCKET = "gs://your-google-cloud-storage-bucket"

vertexai.init(
    project=PROJECT_ID,
    location=LOCATION,
    staging_bucket=STAGING_BUCKET,
)

# Prepare your agent for Agent Engine
app = reasoning_engines.AdkApp(
    agent=business_consultant,
    enable_tracing=True,
)

# Deploy your agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine
remote_app = agent_engines.create(
    agent_engine=business_consultant,
    requirements=[
        "google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]"   
    ]
)

print(f"Deployed agent: {remote_app.resource_name}")

# Query the deployed agent
for event in remote_app.stream_query(
    user_id="production_user",
    session_id="consultation_session_001",
    message="Help me analyze market expansion opportunities",
):
    print(event)
```

**Important Notes:**

- The exact deployment API may vary based on ADK version
- Memory services are automatically configured in production
- Session management is handled by Vertex AI Agent Engine
- Monitoring and logging are built-in features

## Real-World Case Study: LegalFirm's Knowledge Revolution

### The Challenge: Institutional Memory Loss

MegaLegal, a 500-attorney law firm, implemented Google ADK to address critical knowledge management challenges:

**The Problems:**

- Senior partners retiring with decades of institutional knowledge
- Associates repeating research already done by colleagues
- Client preferences and case strategies not shared across teams
- Inconsistent approaches to similar legal issues

**The ADK Solution:**

## Memory Best Practices

### 1. Design Memory Architecture for Your Use Case

```python
# Different memory architectures for different scenarios

# Customer Support: Focus on working and autobiographical memory
customer_support_memory = {
    "working": {"retention": "session", "capacity": "high"},
    "autobiographical": {"retention": "permanent", "privacy": "strict"},
    "episodic": {"retention": "6_months", "learning_focus": "resolution_patterns"}
}

# Research Assistant: Emphasize semantic and episodic memory
research_memory = {
    "semantic": {"retention": "permanent", "update_frequency": "continuous"},
    "episodic": {"retention": "permanent", "pattern_extraction": "enabled"},
    "working": {"retention": "project_duration", "capacity": "very_high"}
}

# Project Manager: Balance all memory types
project_management_memory = {
    "working": {"retention": "project_duration"},
    "episodic": {"retention": "permanent", "success_tracking": "enabled"},
    "procedural": {"retention": "permanent", "pattern_learning": "enabled"},
    "autobiographical": {"retention": "permanent", "team_focused": True}
}
```

## Your 24-Hour Challenge: Build a Memory-Enabled Business Agent

**The Challenge:** Create an agent using Google ADK with persistent memory that gets smarter over time.

**Scenario:** Business advisor agent that helps with strategic decisions

**Required Components:**

1. **Session State:** Track current analysis session
2. **Long-term Memory:** Remember past advice and outcomes using MemoryService
3. **User State:** Build user relationship and preferences using state scoping

**Implementation Steps:**

```python
# Step 1: Set up your ADK environment
# pip install google-adk

from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
from google.adk.memory import InMemoryMemoryService
from google.adk.runners import Runner
from google.adk.tools import FunctionTool, ToolContext

# Create a custom business memory search tool for the challenge
def search_business_memory(query: str, tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict:
    """Search memory for relevant business consulting experiences.
    
    Args:
        query: The search query for past consulting experiences
        tool_context: ADK tool context providing access to memory service
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing relevant past consulting experiences
    """
    try:
        # Use ToolContext to search memory
        memory_results = tool_context.search_memory(query)
        
        if memory_results and memory_results.memories:
            consulting_experiences = []
            for memory in memory_results.memories:
                if memory.content and memory.content.parts:
                    for part in memory.content.parts:
                        if part.text:

            "message": f"Business memory search failed: {str(e)}",
            "query": query
        }

# Create the business memory search tool
business_memory_tool = FunctionTool(func=search_business_memory)

# Step 2: Create your memory-enabled agent
business_advisor = LlmAgent(
    name="strategic_business_advisor",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="""
    You are a strategic business advisor with persistent memory.
    
    Use your capabilities to:
    - Track ongoing strategic discussions using session state
    - Learn from past advice and outcomes using search_business_memory tool
    - Apply business frameworks and knowledge from memory
    - Personalize advice based on user state (use user: prefix)
    
    Always reference relevant past interactions and learnings when available.

    return "Memory persistence test completed"

# Run the test
# asyncio.run(test_memory_persistence())
```

**Success Criteria:**

- Agent remembers previous conversations across sessions ✓
- Agent learns from interaction outcomes and improves advice ✓
- Agent personalizes responses based on user interaction history ✓
- Agent can explain recommendations based on past learnings ✓
- Memory system handles privacy and performance requirements ✓

**Production Upgrade Path:**

For production deployment, upgrade to Vertex AI services:

```python
# Production configuration
from google.adk.sessions import VertexAiSessionService
from google.adk.memory import VertexAiRagMemoryService

# Requires Google Cloud setup
session_service = VertexAiSessionService(
    project="your-project-id",
    location="us-central1"
)

memory_service = VertexAiRagMemoryService(
    rag_corpus="projects/your-project/locations/us-central1/ragCorpora/business-knowledge"
)

# Deploy to Agent Engine
from vertexai import agent_engines

production_agent = agent_engines.create(
    agent_engine=business_advisor,
    requirements=["google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]"]
)
```

## Chapter Wrap-Up: From Tools to Trusted AI Partners

Memory transforms agents from reactive tools into proactive partners. With Google ADK's session state and memory services, you can build agents that understand context, learn from experience, and provide increasingly valuable insights over time.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Session State** provides short-term memory within conversations using ADK's built-in state management
- **MemoryService** enables long-term knowledge storage across sessions accessible via `ToolContext.search_memory()`
- **State Scoping** (user:, app:, temp:) allows for different memory persistence levels
- **Production Deployment** via Vertex AI Agent Engine scales memory-enabled agents reliably
- **Vertex AI RAG** integration provides enterprise-grade semantic search capabilities

The most successful AI implementations aren't those with the most powerful models - they're those with thoughtful memory architectures that remember what matters, learn from experience, and build trust through consistent, contextual interactions.

**Real-World Impact:**

Organizations using ADK's memory capabilities report:

- 60-80% reduction in repeated questions and requests
- 3x faster onboarding for new team members working with AI agents
- 90%+ user satisfaction due to personalized, context-aware interactions
- Significant reduction in knowledge silos and institutional memory loss

In our next chapter, we'll explore how to deploy these intelligent, memory-enabled agents into production environments where they can handle real business workloads at scale.

---

*Next Chapter Preview: "Production Deployment: Scaling Agent Intelligence" - Where we'll learn advanced deployment patterns, monitoring strategies, and enterprise-scale architecture for business-critical agent applications.*

**Quick Reflection:**

- What business processes would benefit most from AI that remembers and learns over time?
- How could persistent memory change the way your team collaborates with AI tools?
- What are your specific privacy and security requirements for memory systems?

**Pro Tip:** Start with ADK's `InMemorySessionService` and `InMemoryMemoryService` for development, then migrate to `VertexAiSessionService` and `VertexAiRagMemoryService` for production. This provides a clear upgrade path without changing your agent logic.
