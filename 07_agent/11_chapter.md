# Chapter 11: Advanced Patterns for AI Agents

> *"The art of building AI agents isn't just about creating intelligent responses—it's about orchestrating symphonies of specialized agents that work together to solve complex, real-world problems."* — A Senior AI Architect

## Why Advanced Patterns Matter

Imagine you're running a global e-commerce platform during Black Friday. A single customer query might require:

- Understanding a product image they uploaded
- Searching through millions of products
- Checking real-time inventory across warehouses
- Processing payment options
- Coordinating with logistics systems

No single agent can handle this complexity efficiently. This is where **advanced AI agent patterns** transform ambitious ideas into production-ready solutions.

## What You'll Master in This Chapter

You'll discover how to architect enterprise-grade AI solutions using three powerful patterns:

1. **Multimodal Agents** - Process text, images, audio, and video simultaneously
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** - Access real-time, domain-specific knowledge
3. **Distributed Agent Systems** - Orchestrate teams of specialized agents

By the end of this chapter, you'll build a complete **Smart Customer Service System** that demonstrates all three patterns working together.

## Introduction: The Evolution of AI Agents

Remember when chatbots could only handle simple FAQ questions? Those days are over. Today's AI agents are sophisticated systems that can:

- Process multiple data types simultaneously (multimodal)
- Access vast knowledge bases in real-time (RAG)
- Coordinate with other agents to solve complex problems (distributed systems)

As AI agents become more sophisticated, developers are moving beyond basic request-response interactions to build complex, multi-agent systems that mirror how human teams collaborate to solve problems.

## Understanding ADK Context Management

Before diving into advanced patterns, it's crucial to understand Google ADK's context system, which is the foundation for how agents share information and maintain state.

### What is Context in ADK?

In ADK, "context" refers to the crucial bundle of information available to your agent and its tools during operations. Think of it as the necessary background knowledge and resources needed to handle tasks effectively.

### Types of Context Objects

ADK provides specialized context objects for different situations:

#### 1. `InvocationContext`
- **Where Used**: Within agent's core implementation methods (`_run_async_impl`)
- **Purpose**: Provides access to the entire state of the current invocation
- **Key Contents**: Direct access to `session`, `agent` instance, `invocation_id`, user content

#### 2. `ToolContext`
- **Where Used**: Passed to function tools
- **Purpose**: Everything `CallbackContext` does, plus specialized tool methods
- **Key Capabilities**: Authentication methods, artifact listing, memory search

#### 3. `CallbackContext`
- **Where Used**: Agent lifecycle callbacks and model interaction callbacks
- **Purpose**: Facilitates inspecting and modifying state, interacting with artifacts

### Practical Context Usage

```python
from google.adk.tools import FunctionTool
from google.adk.tools.tool_context import ToolContext

def analyze_data(query: str, tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict:
    """Example tool function using ADK context properly."""
    
    # Read previous state
    previous_analysis = tool_context.state.get("previous_analysis", {})
    user_preferences = tool_context.state.get("user_preferences", {})
    
    # Perform analysis
    results = {
        "query": query,
        "findings": ["insight1", "insight2"],
        "confidence": 0.85
    }
    
    # Save results to state for future agents
    tool_context.state["current_analysis"] = results
    tool_context.state["last_query"] = query
    
    return results

def create_context_aware_agent():
    """Create an agent that properly uses ADK context."""
    
    analysis_tool = FunctionTool(
        func=analyze_data,
        name="analyze_data",
        description="Analyze data with context awareness"
    )
    
    agent = LlmAgent(
        name="ContextAwareAgent",
        model="gemini-2.5-flash",
        instruction="""You are a data analyst with memory.
        
        Use the analyze_data tool to process queries. You can reference
        previous analyses from the conversation state to provide continuity
        and build upon earlier insights.""",
        tools=[analysis_tool]
    )
    
    return agent
```

### State Management Best Practices

- **Use Prefixes**: `user:` for user-level data, `temp:` for temporary data
- **Keep State Minimal**: Only store essential information
- **Document State Keys**: Use consistent naming conventions

## Pattern 1: Multimodal Agents - Beyond Text

### The "Why" Behind Multimodal Agents

**Why settle for text-only when the world is rich with images, sounds, and videos?**

Consider Netflix's customer support. When a user reports a streaming issue, they might:

- Send a screenshot of the error
- Describe the problem in text
- Upload a screen recording showing the glitch

A multimodal agent can process all three inputs simultaneously to provide better support than any text-only system ever could.

### What Are Multimodal Agents?

Multimodal agents are AI systems that can understand and process multiple types of data simultaneously:

- **Text** - Natural language understanding
- **Images** - Visual recognition and analysis
- **Audio** - Speech recognition and sound analysis
- **Video** - Motion detection and temporal understanding

### Key Concepts and Capabilities

**Multimodal LLMs**: Foundation models like Google's Gemini can understand and process multiple data types simultaneously, enabling:

**Use Cases:**

- **Image Captioning**: Generating detailed textual descriptions of images
- **Visual Q&A**: Answering complex questions about visual content
- **Audio Transcription and Analysis**: Converting speech to text and analyzing tone, sentiment, and intent
- **Document Understanding**: Processing PDFs, forms, and handwritten content
- **Video Analysis**: Understanding temporal sequences and extracting insights from video content

### Real-World Example: Smart Insurance Claims Agent

Let's build a practical multimodal agent for insurance claims processing:

### Advanced Multimodal Use Case: Video Analysis

For more complex scenarios, you can process video content:

```python
def analyze_security_footage(self, video_url: str, incident_time: str) -> dict:
    """Analyzes security footage for incident verification.
    
    Args:
        video_url: URL of the security video
        incident_time: Timestamp of the reported incident
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with video analysis results
    """
    # Extract frames around the incident time
    video_part = Part.from_uri(video_url, mime_type="video/mp4")
    
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze this security footage around timestamp {incident_time}.
    
    Look for:
    1. Vehicle movements and positions
    2. Weather conditions
    3. Lighting conditions
    4. Any unusual activities
    5. Timeline of events
    
    Provide a chronological description of what occurred.
    """
    
    response = self.multimodal_model.generate_content([prompt, video_part])
    
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "timeline_analysis": response.text,
        "incident_confirmed": True,
        "additional_evidence_needed": False
    }
```

### Pro Tips for Multimodal Agents

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate file types and sizes before processing
2. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle corrupted media files
3. **Cost Management**: Multimodal processing can be expensive; implement smart caching
4. **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure sensitive media data is handled according to regulations

### Pause and Reflect 🤔

**Quick Challenge**: Think of a business problem in your industry where combining text, image, and audio analysis could provide breakthrough insights. How would you structure the agent workflow?

## Pattern 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) - Knowledge on Demand

### The "Why" Behind RAG

**Why train massive models when you can teach them to research?**

Here's a story that illustrates the power of RAG: A pharmaceutical company's AI assistant needed to answer questions about drug interactions. Training a model on all medical literature would be:

- Impossibly expensive
- Quickly outdated  
- Legally risky (what if the training data was wrong?)

Instead, they built a RAG system that retrieves the latest, verified medical information in real-time. The result? An AI assistant that's always current, factual, and traceable to authoritative sources.

### What Is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances AI responses by dynamically retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases. Instead of relying solely on training data, RAG agents actively search for current, domain-specific information to inform their responses.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant RAG_Agent
    participant Vector_DB
    participant LLM
    participant Knowledge_Base
    
    User->>RAG_Agent: "What's our Q3 revenue forecast?"
    RAG_Agent->>Vector_DB: Search for "Q3 revenue forecast"
    Vector_DB->>Knowledge_Base: Retrieve relevant documents
    Knowledge_Base-->>Vector_DB: Financial reports, projections
    Vector_DB-->>RAG_Agent: Top 5 relevant chunks
    RAG_Agent->>LLM: User query + retrieved context
    LLM-->>RAG_Agent: Generated response with citations
    RAG_Agent-->>User: "Based on our latest financial reports..."
    
    note over RAG_Agent: Always includes source citations
    note over Vector_DB: Semantic similarity search
    note over LLM: Grounded in retrieved facts
```

### How RAG Works in Practice

The RAG process follows a clear sequence:

1. **Query Processing**: The user's question is analyzed and converted into search terms
2. **Information Retrieval**: Relevant documents are found using semantic search
3. **Context Augmentation**: Retrieved information is added to the user's original query
4. **Generation**: The LLM generates a response based on both the query and retrieved context
5. **Source Attribution**: The response includes citations to original sources

### Monitoring and Optimization

**Key Metrics to Track:**

1. **Response Quality**: User satisfaction scores, accuracy metrics
2. **Performance**: Latency, throughput, error rates
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Token usage, compute costs per interaction
4. **Agent Coordination**: Handoff success rates, agent utilization

**Optimization Strategies:**

- **Caching**: Cache RAG results and multimodal analyses
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across agent instances  
- **Model Selection**: Use appropriate model sizes for each agent
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar requests for efficiency

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall #1: The "Everything Agent" Trap

**Problem**: Trying to build one agent that does everything.

**Solution**: Embrace specialization. Each agent should excel at one specific task

```python
# ❌ DON'T: One agent for everything
massive_agent = LlmAgent(
    instruction="Handle customer service, technical support, billing, legal questions, image analysis, document processing, and financial advice..."
)

# ✅ DO: Specialized agents working together
customer_service_team = SequentialAgent(
    sub_agents=[
        intake_agent,      # Input processing
        routing_agent,     # Intelligent routing  
        specialist_pool    # Specialized handlers
    ]
)
```

### Pitfall #2: Ignoring Error Propagation

**Problem**: One failed agent breaks the entire system.

**Solution**: Implement graceful degradation and fallback strategies.

```python
def create_resilient_agent_system():
    """Create agent system with built-in resilience."""
    
    primary_agent = LlmAgent(name="PrimaryAgent", ...)
    fallback_agent = LlmAgent(name="FallbackAgent", ...)
    
    # Implement circuit breaker pattern
    resilient_system = ResilientAgentWrapper(
        primary=primary_agent,
        fallback=fallback_agent,
        failure_threshold=3,
        recovery_timeout=60
    )
    
    return resilient_system
```

### Pitfall #3: Neglecting Context Management

**Problem**: Agents lose context between interactions.

**Solution**: Implement proper state management and memory systems.

```python
# Use persistent session state
session_service = CloudSessionService(
    memory_enabled=True,
    context_window=10,  # Remember last 10 interactions
    state_persistence=True
)
```

## Your 24-Hour Challenge 🚀

### Build a Mini Smart Assistant in 24 Hours

Create a simple system that combines all three patterns:

**Requirements:**

1. **Multimodal**: Accept text and image inputs
2. **RAG**: Search a small knowledge base (your company docs)
3. **Distributed**: Use 2-3 specialized agents

**Suggested Architecture:**

```text
Input Handler → RAG Researcher → Response Synthesizer
      ↓              ↓              ↓
  Multimodal    Knowledge Base   Final Output
  Processing      Search
```

**Success Metrics:**

- ✅ Handles both text and image queries
- ✅ Retrieves relevant information from knowledge base
- ✅ Agents coordinate effectively
- ✅ Provides coherent, helpful responses

**Pro Tip**: Start with the RAG pattern, then add multimodal, then distributed coordination.
