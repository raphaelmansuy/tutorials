# How to create professional diagrams prompt for software engineering concepts with OpenAI and ImageGen4 

## Image Generation Models

### ImageGen4

**Model:** `ImageGen4`

DeepMind's May 2025 text-to-image model with exceptional prompt adherence, capable of generating images with great detail, rich lighting, and few distracting artifacts.

- **Aspect Ratio:** To adjust the aspect ratio, add `--aspect_ratio` (options: 1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:4).
- **Language:** Non-English input will be translated first.
- **Model Served:** `imagen-4.0-ultra-generate-05-20` (Google Vertex)
- **Token Limit:** Maximum input of 480 tokens.

### OpenAI (ChatGPT Image Generation)

**Model:** `OpenAI Image Generation GPT-Image-1`

OpenAI's model powers image generation in ChatGPT, offering exceptional prompt adherence, level of detail, and quality. It supports editing, restyling, and combining images attached to the latest user query.

**Optional parameters:**

- `--aspect` (options: 1:1, 3:2, 2:3): Aspect ratio of the output image
- `--quality` (options: high, medium, low): Image resolution
- `--use-mask`: Indicates that the last attached image is a mask for inpainting (editing specific regions). The mask must match the dimensions of the base image, with transparent (zero-alpha) areas showing which parts to edit.
