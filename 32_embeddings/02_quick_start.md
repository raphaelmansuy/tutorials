# Chapter 2: Quick Start - Your First Embedding-based Search

## Get Results in 5 Minutes

Let's dive straight into building a working semantic search system. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a functioning search engine that understands meaning, not just keywords. We'll start with the simplest possible implementation and then explore what makes it work.

## Prerequisites Check

Before we begin, ensure you have:

- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- Basic familiarity with pip and virtual environments
- A text editor or IDE
- Terminal/command prompt access

## Step 1: Environment Setup

First, let's create a clean environment and install the necessary libraries:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv embedding_tutorial
source embedding_tutorial/bin/activate  # On Windows: embedding_tutorial\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install sentence-transformers faiss-cpu numpy
```

**Package Overview:**

- **sentence-transformers**: Provides easy access to state-of-the-art embedding models
- **faiss-cpu**: Facebook's similarity search library for efficient vector operations
- **numpy**: Essential for numerical operations on embeddings

## Step 2: Your First Semantic Search (5 Minutes)

Create a new file called `quick_search.py` and add the following code:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Load a pre-trained embedding model
print("Loading embedding model...")
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
print(f"Model loaded. Embedding dimension: {model.get_sentence_embedding_dimension()}")

# Step 2: Create sample documents to search through
documents = [
    "I love programming in Python",
    "Machine learning is fascinating",
    "The weather is beautiful today",
    "Artificial intelligence will change the world",
    "I enjoy coding and building applications",
    "It's a sunny day outside",
    "Deep learning models are very powerful",
    "Software development is my passion",
    "The sky is clear and blue",
    "Neural networks can solve complex problems"
]

# Step 3: Convert documents to embeddings
print("Creating embeddings for documents...")
doc_embeddings = model.encode(documents)
print(f"Created {len(doc_embeddings)} embeddings, each with {doc_embeddings.shape[1]} dimensions")

# Step 4: Create FAISS index for fast similarity search
dimension = doc_embeddings.shape[1]
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)  # L2 distance (Euclidean)
index.add(doc_embeddings.astype('float32'))
print(f"FAISS index created with {index.ntotal} vectors")

# Step 5: Perform search queries
queries = [
    "I want to learn about coding",
    "Tell me about the weather",
    "What is AI?"
]

print("\n" + "="*50)
print("SEMANTIC SEARCH RESULTS")
print("="*50)

for query in queries:
    print(f"\nQuery: '{query}'")
    print("-" * 40)
    
    # Convert query to embedding
    query_embedding = model.encode([query])
    
    # Search for similar documents
    k = 3  # Return top 3 results
    distances, indices = index.search(query_embedding.astype('float32'), k)
    
    # Display results
    for i, (distance, doc_idx) in enumerate(zip(distances[0], indices[0])):
        similarity_score = 1 / (1 + distance)  # Convert distance to similarity score
        print(f"  {i+1}. [{similarity_score:.3f}] {documents[doc_idx]}")
```

## Step 3: Run Your First Search

Execute the script:

```bash
python quick_search.py
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Loading embedding model...
Model loaded. Embedding dimension: 384
Creating embeddings for documents...
Created 10 embeddings, each with 384 dimensions
FAISS index created with 10 vectors

==================================================

```

## Understanding What Just Happened

### The Magic of Semantic Understanding

Notice how the search understood concepts, not just keywords:

- **"learn about coding"** matched with **"programming"**, **"coding"**, and **"software development"**
- **"weather"** found **"sunny day"** and **"sky is clear"** even without the word "weather"
- **"What is AI?"** connected to **"artificial intelligence"**, **"deep learning"**, and **"neural networks"**

This is the power of embeddings â€“ they capture semantic meaning in numerical form.

```

### Key Components Explained

1. **Sentence Transformer Model**: Converts text into 384-dimensional vectors
2. **FAISS Index**: Efficiently stores and searches through vector embeddings
3. **Similarity Computation**: Finds vectors closest to the query vector
4. **Distance to Similarity**: Converts mathematical distance to intuitive similarity scores

## Experimenting with Different Models

Let's compare different embedding models to understand their characteristics:

```python
# models_comparison.py
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import time

# Different models to compare
models_to_test = [
    'all-MiniLM-L6-v2',      # Small, fast model
    'all-mpnet-base-v2',     # Larger, more accurate model
    'paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2' # Specialized for paraphrase detection
]

test_text = "Machine learning is transforming the world"

print("Model Comparison:")
print("="*60)

for model_name in models_to_test:
    print(f"\nTesting: {model_name}")
    
    # Load model and measure time
    start_time = time.time()
    model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
    load_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Get embedding and measure encoding time
    start_time = time.time()
    embedding = model.encode(test_text)
    encode_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    print(f"  Dimensions: {len(embedding)}")
    print(f"  Load time: {load_time:.2f} seconds")
    print(f"  Encode time: {encode_time:.4f} seconds")
    print(f"  Embedding (first 5 values): {embedding[:5]}")
```

## Building a More Realistic Example

Now let's create a more practical search system with a larger document corpus:

```python
# realistic_search.py
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss
import numpy as np
import json
from typing import List, Tuple

class SemanticSearchEngine:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'):
        """Initialize the search engine with a specified model."""
        print(f"Loading model: {model_name}")
        self.model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
        self.documents = []
        self.index = None
        self.embeddings = None
        
    def add_documents(self, documents: List[str]):
        """Add documents to the search corpus."""
        print(f"Adding {len(documents)} documents...")
        self.documents.extend(documents)
        
        # Create embeddings for all documents
        all_embeddings = self.model.encode(self.documents, show_progress_bar=True)
        
        # Create or update FAISS index
        if self.index is None:
            dimension = all_embeddings.shape[1]
            self.index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
        
        self.index.add(all_embeddings.astype('float32'))
        self.embeddings = all_embeddings
        print(f"Index now contains {self.index.ntotal} documents")
        
    def search(self, query: str, k: int = 5) -> List[Tuple[str, float]]:
        """Search for documents similar to the query."""
        if self.index is None:
            raise ValueError("No documents added to search engine")
            
        # Encode the query
        query_embedding = self.model.encode([query])
        
        # Perform search
        distances, indices = self.index.search(query_embedding.astype('float32'), k)
        
        # Convert to results with similarity scores
        results = []
        for distance, idx in zip(distances[0], indices[0]):
            if idx < len(self.documents):  # Valid index
                similarity = 1 / (1 + distance)
                results.append((self.documents[idx], similarity))
                
        return results
    
    def save_index(self, filepath: str):
        """Save the search index to disk."""
        if self.index is not None:
            faiss.write_index(self.index, f"{filepath}.faiss")
            with open(f"{filepath}_docs.json", 'w') as f:
                json.dump(self.documents, f)
            print(f"Index saved to {filepath}")
    
    def load_index(self, filepath: str):
        """Load a previously saved search index."""
        self.index = faiss.read_index(f"{filepath}.faiss")
        with open(f"{filepath}_docs.json", 'r') as f:
            self.documents = json.load(f)

## Performance Analysis

Let's measure and understand the performance characteristics:

```python
# performance_test.py
import time
import numpy as np
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss

def benchmark_embedding_performance():
    """Benchmark different aspects of embedding performance."""
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    
    # Test data of varying sizes
    test_sizes = [10, 100, 1000, 5000]
    sample_text = "This is a sample document for performance testing. " * 10
    
    print("Embedding Performance Benchmark")
    print("="*50)
    print(f"{'Documents':<12} {'Encode Time':<12} {'Per Doc (ms)':<12} {'Memory (MB)':<12}")
    print("-" * 50)
    
    for size in test_sizes:
        documents = [f"{sample_text} Document {i}" for i in range(size)]
        
        # Measure encoding time
        start_time = time.time()
        embeddings = model.encode(documents, show_progress_bar=False)
        encode_time = time.time() - start_time
        
        # Calculate metrics
        per_doc_ms = (encode_time / size) * 1000
        memory_mb = embeddings.nbytes / (1024 * 1024)
        
        print(f"{size:<12} {encode_time:<12.2f} {per_doc_ms:<12.2f} {memory_mb:<12.2f}")

def benchmark_search_performance():
    """Benchmark search performance with different index sizes."""
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    
    # Create test corpus
    corpus_sizes = [1000, 5000, 10000, 50000]
    sample_text = "Sample document for search performance testing"
    
    print("\nSearch Performance Benchmark")
    print("="*50)
    print(f"{'Corpus Size':<12} {'Index Time':<12} {'Search Time':<12} {'QPS':<12}")
    print("-" * 50)
    
    for size in corpus_sizes:
        documents = [f"{sample_text} {i}" for i in range(size)]
        
        # Create embeddings and index
        start_time = time.time()
        embeddings = model.encode(documents, show_progress_bar=False)
        index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embeddings.shape[1])
        index.add(embeddings.astype('float32'))
        index_time = time.time() - start_time
        
        # Test search performance
        query_embedding = model.encode(["test query"])
        
        # Warm up
        for _ in range(10):
            index.search(query_embedding.astype('float32'), 5)
        
        # Measure search time
        num_queries = 100

        qps = 1 / avg_search_time
        
        print(f"{size:<12} {index_time:<12.2f} {avg_search_time:<12.4f} {qps:<12.0f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    benchmark_embedding_performance()
    benchmark_search_performance()
```

## Understanding the Results

### What Makes This Work?

1. **Pre-trained Models**: The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model was trained on millions of text pairs to understand semantic similarity

2. **Vector Space Mathematics**: Similar concepts cluster together in the 384-dimensional space

3. **Efficient Search**: FAISS uses optimized algorithms for fast nearest neighbor search

4. **Distance Metrics**: L2 (Euclidean) distance provides a meaningful similarity measure

### Performance Characteristics

From our benchmarks, you'll typically see:

- **Encoding speed**: ~1-10ms per document for small models
- **Search speed**: Sub-millisecond for thousands of documents
- **Memory usage**: ~1.5KB per document (384 dimensions Ã— 4 bytes)
- **Accuracy**: 60-70% similarity to human judgments

## Common Patterns and Variations

### Pattern 1: Batch Processing

For large document collections, process in batches:

```python
def encode_documents_in_batches(model, documents, batch_size=32):
    """Encode documents in batches for memory efficiency."""
    all_embeddings = []
    
    for i in range(0, len(documents), batch_size):
        batch = documents[i:i + batch_size]
        batch_embeddings = model.encode(batch)
        all_embeddings.extend(batch_embeddings)
        
        if i % (batch_size * 10) == 0:
            print(f"Processed {i + len(batch)}/{len(documents)} documents")
    
    return np.array(all_embeddings)
```

### Pattern 2: Similarity Thresholding

Filter results by minimum similarity:

```python
def search_with_threshold(search_engine, query, min_similarity=0.7, k=10):
    """Search with minimum similarity threshold."""
    results = search_engine.search(query, k=k)
    return [(doc, score) for doc, score in results if score >= min_similarity]
```

### Pattern 3: Hybrid Search

Combine keyword and semantic search:

```python
def hybrid_search(search_engine, query, documents, k=5):
    """Combine semantic and keyword-based search."""
    # Semantic search results
    semantic_results = search_engine.search(query, k=k*2)
    
    # Simple keyword search
    query_terms = query.lower().split()
    keyword_results = []
    
    for i, doc in enumerate(documents):
        score = sum(1 for term in query_terms if term in doc.lower())
        if score > 0:
            keyword_results.append((doc, score / len(query_terms)))
    
    # Combine and re-rank (simplified approach)
    combined_scores = {}
    
    for doc, score in semantic_results:
        combined_scores[doc] = score * 0.7  # Weight semantic search
    
    for doc, score in keyword_results:
        if doc in combined_scores:
            combined_scores[doc] += score * 0.3  # Add keyword score
        else:
            combined_scores[doc] = score * 0.3
    
    # Sort by combined score
    sorted_results = sorted(combined_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return sorted_results[:k]
```

## Next Steps and Exploration

### Immediate Experiments You Can Try

1. **Different Models**: Try `all-mpnet-base-v2` for better accuracy
2. **Multilingual Search**: Use `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`
3. **Domain-Specific**: Test with scientific text using `allenai-specter`
4. **Larger Corpus**: Load real datasets from your domain

### Understanding Limitations

This quick start demonstrates the basics, but production systems need:

- **Index persistence**: Save/load indexes to avoid recomputation
- **Incremental updates**: Add new documents without rebuilding
- **Distributed search**: Handle millions of documents across servers
- **Query optimization**: Handle complex queries and filters
- **Evaluation metrics**: Measure search quality systematically

## Chapter Summary

In just 5 minutes, you've built a working semantic search system that:

- **Understands meaning** beyond keyword matching
- **Processes natural language queries** effectively  
- **Scales** to thousands of documents
- **Provides similarity scores** for ranking results

The key insights from this quick start:

1. **Embeddings bridge human and machine understanding** by converting text to numerical vectors
2. **Pre-trained models work immediately** without domain-specific training
3. **Vector similarity search is fast and effective** for most applications
4. **The technology is mature and accessible** through simple APIs

### What's Next

This foundation prepares you for the deeper exploration in Chapter 3, where we'll:

- Understand the mathematical foundations of embeddings
- Compare all six embedding types in detail
- Learn when to choose each approach
- Implement more sophisticated search patterns

The quick start showed you **what's possible**. Chapter 3 will show you **how it works** and **when to use what**.
