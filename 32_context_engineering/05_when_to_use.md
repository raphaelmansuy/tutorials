## 5.1 Prime Scenarios

- **High Chaos**: Stock bots riding market rollercoasters.
- **Deep Dives**: Legal AI parsing contracts.
- **Personal Touch**: Chatbots recalling your last rant.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Research systems where agents collaborate to gather insights from different domains.

## 5.2 Complexity Ladder

- **Basic**: Order tracker (simple context, big wins).
- **Medium**: Trip planner with your travel history.
- **Expert**: Diagnostic AI with medical archives.

## 5.3 Myth-Busting

"More context = better"? Wrong. Overload jams the system‚Äîlike stuffing a suitcase 'til it bursts. Quality beats quantity.

**What Would You Do?**: Your bot's slow with too much data. Fix it.

## 5.4 The Agentic Context Decision Framework

**üéØ Use Agentic Context When:**

- **Multi-step reasoning required**: "Plan a trip considering weather, budget, and my dietary restrictions"
- **Dynamic information needs**: Query requirements change based on intermediate findings
- **Cross-domain synthesis**: Combining medical, financial, and legal information
- **Real-time adaptation**: Context needs evolve as conversation progresses

**‚ùå Stick with Traditional Context When:**

- Simple, predictable queries
- Single-domain information retrieval
- Cost-sensitive applications (agentic systems use more compute)
- Low-latency requirements (sub-100ms responses)

## 5.5 Decision Matrix: Choose Your Approach

| Use Case | Traditional RAG | Reasoning-Enhanced | Agentic | MCP |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|---------|-----|
| Simple FAQ | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚ùå Overkill | ‚ùå Overkill | ‚ùå Overkill |
| Customer Support | ‚úÖ Good | ‚úÖ Better | ‚ùå Expensive | ‚úÖ Enterprise |
| Research Assistant | ‚ùå Limited | ‚úÖ Good | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚úÖ Scalable |
| Multi-source Enterprise | ‚ùå Complex | ‚úÖ Manageable | ‚úÖ Powerful | ‚úÖ Ideal |

## 5.6 Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Traditional RAG**: Low cost, fast setup, good for straightforward queries
**Reasoning-Enhanced**: Medium cost, better accuracy, ideal for complex domains
**Agentic Systems**: High cost, maximum flexibility, perfect for research/analysis
**MCP-Based**: Variable cost, fastest integration, best for enterprise environments

## 5.7 Getting Started Recommendations

**Beginners**: Start with traditional RAG on a single context source
**Intermediate**: Add reasoning for complex domain queries
**Advanced**: Implement agentic systems for multi-domain challenges
**Enterprise**: Evaluate MCP for standardized, secure context integration
